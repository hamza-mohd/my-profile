- 👋 Hi, I’m saxenamilan
- 👀 I’m interested in open source and bringing my visual and design talents to bear on projects.
- 🌱 I’m spend most of my time in Figma and tools other than GitHub, so be sure to find me in those tools.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that offer an intuitive user experience, but need help in separating the concern of too simple vs. too complex. There is a balance that needs to be struck.
- 📫 How to reach me - just create an issue on this repo.
